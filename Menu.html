                    The rib-eye steak is perhaps the finest of all steaks, offering a combination of luxurious tenderness plus big, beefy flavor. Whether you opt for the boneless or bone-in version, ribeye steaks are ideal candidates for the grill. Sometimes you'll hear it called a rib-eye, other times a rib steak, but for all practical purposes, the two terms are synonymous. Cook over medium-high heat until it reaches the desired doneness.

                <p>
                    Alternately called a New York strip, Kansas City strip, strip loin, or top loin steak, the strip steak is every bit as magnificent as the ribeye. Strip steaks might pack more intense beef flavor than a ribeye, possibly at the expense of tenderness, but there are so many variables—including grading, aging, and marbling—that it's a draw. The bone-in version, while less common, is sometimes called a club steak.

                    The porterhouse steak is a cross-section of the beef short loin taken from the rump end. It features a cross-section of the backbone with a portion of the ribeye muscle on one side and a slice of tenderloin on the other side. These will cost you an arm and a leg at a steakhouse, but you can grill porterhouse steaks at home for a fraction of the cost.

                <p>
                    T-bone steaks are a lot like porterhouse steaks, only they are cut slightly forward on the short loin and thus have less or even none of the tenderloin muscle attached. Conversely, because they come further away from the rump, the ribeye muscle in the t-bone is slightly more tender than in a porterhouse.

                <p>
                    Our first selection to come from somewhere other than the short loin section of the cow, skirt steak comes to us from the beef plate primal cut, specifically from the inside of the chest and abdominal cavity. Thick-grained and bound with chewy connective tissue, the skirt steak is nevertheless extremely flavorful. If you cook it very fast on a very hot grill (even directly on the coals), it will make a splendid dinner. Be sure to slice it against the grain and try it in tacos.
